====== David ======


===== Mga Katotohanan: =====

Si David ang ikalawang hari ng Bayan ng Israel. Naglingkod siya ng buong katapatan sa Diyos.

  * Pinili ng Diyos si David na maging hari kahit siya ay bata pa at nal-aalaga lang ng mga tupa ng kanyang ama.
  * Naging magiting at magaling na sundalo si David at marami siyang ipnanalong labanan.
  * Nagkasala si David sa Diyos pero dahil nagsisi siya, pinatawad siya ng Diyos.
  * Si Jesus ang “Messiah” ay galing sa lahi ni David kaya “Anak ni David” ang isang pang tawag sa kanya.
