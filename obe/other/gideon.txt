===== Mga Katotohanan: =====

Si Gideon ay isang Israelitang pinili ng Diyos upang iligtas at ipagtanggol ang bayan ng Israel mula sa pang-aapi ng mga kaaway nila.

  * Kahit takot si Gideon sa mga Midianita, ginamit pa rin siya ng Diyos para pamunuan ang mga Israelita para labanan at talunin ang mga Midianita.
