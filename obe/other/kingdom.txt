====== kaharian ======

===== Kahulugan: =====

Ang kaharian ay binubuo ng grupo ng maraming tao na pinamumunuan ng isang hari. Ito ay tumutukoy din sa mga lugar kung saan ang isang hari o ang isang pinuno ang namumuno o ang may kapangyarihan. Maaaring matawag na kaharian ang isang lugar maliit man ito o malaki kahit ito ay isang bansa o isang lungsod lang, kung pinamumunuan ito ng isang hari.

  * Ang salitang “Kaharian” ay maaaring tumukoy sa espiritwal na bagay gaya ng “Kaharian ng Diyos.”
  * Ang Diyos ang namumuno sa lahat ng nilikha ngunit ang ibig sabihin ng “Kaharian ng Diyos” ay ang paghahari ng Diyos sa mga taong isinuko ang buhay nila kay Jesus. Naniniwala at sumusunod kay Jesus ang mga taong ito.
  * Sinasabi din sa Bibliya na ang tungkol sa “kaharian” ni Satan kung saan panandalian ang pamumuno niya sa maraming bagay dito sa mundo. Puno ng kasamaan ang kaharian niya at tinatawag itong “kadiliman.”

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When referring to a physical region that is ruled over by a king, the term "kingdom" could be translated as, "country (ruled by a king)" or "king's territory" or "region ruled by a king."
  * In a spiritual sense, "kingdom" could be translated as "ruling" or "reigning" or "controlling" or "governing."
  * One way to translate "kingdom of priests" might be, "spiritual priests who are ruled by God."
  * The phrase, "kingdom of light" could be translated as, "God's reign that is good like light" or "when God, who is light, rules people" or "the light and goodness of God's kingdom." It is best to keep the word "light" in this expression since that is a very important term in the Bible.
  * Note that the term "kingdom" is different from an empire, which is ruled by an emperor.
