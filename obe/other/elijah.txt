====== Elijah ======


===== Mga Katotohanan: =====

Si Elijah ay propeta ng Diyos noong panahon ni haring Ahab.

  * Sinabi ni propeta Elijah kay Ahab na hindi uulan sa loob ng tatloâ€™t kalahating taon bilang parusa sa Israel dahil sumamba sila sa diyos-diyosan.
  * Mga uwak at isang babaeng balo ang nagpakain kay Elijah sa buong panahon ng taggutom at nang siya ay nagtatago kay Ahab dahil gusto siya nitong ipapatay.
  * God did many miracles through Elijah and showed Israel that Yahweh is the only true God.
  * Si Ahab ay may 450 na propeta ng diyos-diyosang si Baal. Hinamon ni Elijah ang mga propeta ni Baal para patunayang si YAHWEH ang tunay na Diyos.
  * Hindi namatay si Elijah dahil literal na kinuha siya ng Diyos at dinala sa langit.
