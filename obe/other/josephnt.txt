===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

  ***[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:22-04|[22-04]]]** She (Mary) was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named **Joseph**.
  ***[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:23-01|[23-01]]]** **Joseph**, the man Mary was engaged to, was a righteous man. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame her, so he planned to quietly divorce her.
  ***[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:23-02|[23-02]]]** The angel said, "**Joseph**, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby in her body is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means, 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins."
  ***[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:23-03|[23-03]]]** So **Joseph** married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.
  ***[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:23-04|[23-04]]]** **Joseph** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.
  ***[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:26-04|[26-04]]]** Jesus said, "The words I just read to you are happening right now." All the people were amazed. "Isn't this the son of **Joseph**?" they said.
