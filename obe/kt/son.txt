====== anak na lalaki ======

===== Kahulugan: =====

Ito ay tumutukoy sa bata o kahit sa kahit anong edad na anak na lalaki. Ginagamit din ito sa mga lalaki na kinupkop at itinuring bilang anak o kapamilya.

  * Ang salitang ito ay ginagamit din sa Bibliya para sa mga apo o kaapu-apuhan. Si Jesus ay tinatawag din na “Anak ni David” dahil siya ay galling sa angkan ni Dvaid.
  * Sa Bagong Tipan ng Bibliya, ginagamit din ang salitang ito para sa mga taong sumasampalataya kay Jesus. Dahil sa pananampalataya nila kay Jesus sila ay nabibilang sa “mga anak ng Diyos” na nagkaroon ng karapatan sa mga ibibigay ng Diyos bilang pamana.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In most occurrences of this term, it is best to translate "son" using the literal term in the language that is used to refer to a son.
  * When translating the term "Son of God," the usual, common term for "son" should be used.
  * When used to refer to a descendant rather than a direct son, the term "descendant" could be used, as in referring to Jesus as the "descendant of David" or in genealogies where sometimes "son" refers to a male descendant.
  * Sometimes "sons" can be translated as "children" when both males and females are being referred to. For example, "sons of God" could be translated as "children of God" since this expression also includes girls and women.
  * The figurative expression "son of" can be translated as "someone who has the characteristics of" or "someone who is like" or "someone who has" or "someone who acts like."
