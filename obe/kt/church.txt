====== simbahan, Iglesia ======

===== Kahulugan: =====

ang salitang “Simbahan” at Iglesya ay may parehong kahulugan. Ito ay ang tawag sa samahan ng mga taong nananampalataya kay Jesus. Palagi silang nagsasama-sama para making ng mga salita ng Diyos.

  * Ang Simbahan ay nakasanayan na ngayon na pantukoy sa gusaling pinagsasambahan ngunit ang Simbahan o Iglesya na sinasabi dito ay ang bawat taong nanalig kay Jesus.
  * Ang Iglesya naman ay hindi tumutukoy sa isang relihiyon dito sa pilipinas kundi tumutukoy din sa tao na pinaghaharian ni Jesus ang buhay.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" or "congregation" or "ones who meet together."
  * The word or phrase that is used to translate this term should also be able to refer to all believers, not just one small group.
  * Make sure that the translation of "church" does not just refer to a building.
  * Also consider how it is translated in a local or national Bible translation. (See: [[tl:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]].)
