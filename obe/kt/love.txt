===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Some languages may have a special word for the unselfish kind of love that God has for people and that he helps people have for others. Ways to translate this might include, "devoted, faithful caring" or "care for unselfishly" or "love from God." Make sure that the word used to translate God's love can include the characteristics of not being focused on self, of giving up one's own interests to benefit others, and loving others no matter what they do.
  * Sometimes the English word "love" describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means, "like very much" or "care for" or "have strong affection for."
  * In contexts where "love" is used to express a strong preference for a thing, food, or activity, this could be translated by "strongly prefer" or "like very much" or "greatly desire."
  * Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.
  * Many languages must express "love" as an action. So for example, they might translate "love is patient, love is kind" as, "when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him."
