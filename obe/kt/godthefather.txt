====== Diyos Ama, Amang nasa Langit ======

===== Mag Katotohanan: =====

Ang salitang Diyos Ama” ay tumutukoy kay YAHWEH, ang tunay na Diyos.

  * ang pangalang “ Diyos Ama” ay nagpapakita kung anong klase ng relasyon ang gusto ng Diyos sa pagitan natin at sa pagitan niya katulad ng relasyon niya kay Jesus. Ito ay hindi pisikal na relasyon kundi espiritwal, kung paanong sinunod at pinarangalan ni Jesus ang Diyos Ama, ganoon din ang gusto niya para sa atin..

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In the phrase "God the Father," it is best to translate "Father" with the same word that the language naturally uses to refer to a human father.
  * The term "Heavenly Father" could be translated by "Father God who lives in Heaven" or "God our Father from Heaven" or "Father who lives in Heaven."
