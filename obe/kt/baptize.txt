====== bawtismo ======

===== Kahulugan: =====

Sa bagong tipan ng bibliya, ang “Bawtismo” ay ang paglulubog sa tubig ng isang mananampalataya ni Jesus bilang tanda ng pakikipag-isa sa kanya at tanda rin ito na nalinis na siya mula sa mga kasalanan niya.

  * Bukod sa pagbabawtismo sa tubig, sinasabi din sa bibliya na mayroon ding bawtismo sa apoy at Banal na Espiritu.
