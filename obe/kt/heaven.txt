====== langit, kalangitan, himpapawid ======

===== Kahulugan: =====

  * Ang salitang “Langit” ay tumutukoy sa lugar na kinarorooanan ng Diyos.

  * Ang “Kalangitan” naman o “Himpapawid” ay tumutukoy sa lahat ng nasa itaas ng mundo kabilang ang mga ulap, mga bituin, buwan, araw at maging  ang ibang mga planeta na hindi natin nakikita dito sa mundo.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When "heaven" is used figuratively, it could be translated as "God."
  * For "kingdom of heaven" in the book of Matthew, it is best to keep the word "heaven" since this is distinctive to Matthew's gospel.
  * The terms "heavens" or "heavenly bodies" could also be translated as, "sun, moon, and stars" or "all the stars in the universe."
  * The phrase, "stars of heaven" could be translated as "stars in the sky" or "stars in the galaxy" or "stars in the universe."
