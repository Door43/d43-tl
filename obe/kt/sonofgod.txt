===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * For the term, "Son of God," it is best to translate "Son" with the same word the language would naturally use to refer to a "son" of a human father.
  * Make sure the word used to translate "son" fits with the word used to translate "father" and that these words are the most natural ones to express a true father-son relationship.
