Nagkwento si Jesus sa mga disipulo niya para maipaliwanag ang mangyayari sa mga tao sa katapusan ng mundo. Sinabi niya, "May taong nagtanim ng buto sa kanyang taniman. Habang natutulog siya may nagtanim ng buto ng damo kasama ng mga buto ng mga trigo at saka siya umalis."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **good seed** - This seed was wheat grain. If this type of seed is not known in your language area, it is best to use a general term for "seed." If there is no general term, it may be necessary to choose a type of grain seed that is known and say, for example, "good seed like rice."
  * **weed seeds** - The weed seeds that were planted would grow up as tall grass but could not be eaten. They were useless.
  * **wheat** - That is, "wheat seeds." Wheat is a kind of grain that grows like a tall grass. It has seeds that people use for food.
