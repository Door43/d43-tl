“Ang asawa mong si Sarai ay magkakaroon ng anak na lalaki. Siya ang anak na ipinangako. Isaac ang ipangalan mo sa kanya. Makikipagkasunduan ako sa kanya at magiging makapangyarihan siyang bansa. Magiging makapangyarihang bansa din si Ishmael pero mananatili kay Isaac ang kasunduan ko.” Pagkatapos pinalitan ng Diyos ang pangalan ni Abram ng Abraham, ang ibig sabihin, “ama ng marami.” Pinalitan din ng Diyos ang pangalan ni Sarai ng Sarah na ang ibig sabihin, “prinsesa”.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * (God continues to speak to Abram.)
  * **son of promise** - Isaac would be the son that God promised to Sarai and Abram. He would also be the son that God would use to give Abram many descendants.
  * **I will make my covenant with him** - This would be the same covenant that God made with Abram.
  * **father of many** - As God had promised, Abraham would become the ancestor of many people who would even become many nations.
  * **princess** - A princess is a daughter of a king. The names Sarai and Sarah apparently both meant "princess." But God changed her name to signify that she would be the mother of many nations, and some of her descendants would be kings.
