Pagdating nila sa lugar na pupuntahan nila, itinali ni Abraham si Isaac at inihiga sa altar. Papatayin na sana ni Abraham si Isaac nang biglang nagsalita ang Diyos at sinabing, â€œHuwag mong saktan ang bata. Napatunayan ko nang may takot ka sa akin dahil hindi mo ipinagkait sa akin ang kaisa-isang mong anak.
