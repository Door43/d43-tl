{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-12-14.jpg?nolink&}}

Iniutos ng Diyos sa mga Israelita na ipagdiwang nila taun-taon ang **“Paskua”** para maalala nila na pinagtagumpay sila ng Diyos laban sa mga Egipcio at iniligtas sila sa pagkakaalipin. Nagdiwang sila kaya nagkatay sila ng tupa na walang kapintasan at kinain nila ito kasama ng tinapay na walang pampaalsa.
