Isang araw habang pinapastol ni Moses ang mga tupa, nakakita siya ng maliit na punong- kahoy na nag-aapoy pero hindi natutupok ang punong-kahoy na ito. Lumapit si Moses para makita ito ng mas mabuti. Habang papalapit siya sa umaapoy na puno, nagsalita ang Diyos at sinabing, “Moses, tanggalin mo ang sandalyas mo dahil nakatayo ka sa banal na lugar.”
