Isang araw may isang mayamang pinuno na lumapit kay Jesus at nagtanong, "Mabuting guro, ano ba ang dapat kong gawin para magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan?" Sumagot si Jesus, “Bakit mo ako tinawag na mabuti? Isa lang ang mabuti, ang Diyos. Kung gusto mong magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan dapat mong sundin ang mga utos ng Diyos.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **rich young ruler** - This man was already a rich and powerful political official, even though he was still young.
  * **came up to Jesus** - That is, "approached Jesus."
  * **Good teacher** - That is, "righteous teacher." He was not saying that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher.
  * **to have eternal life** - That is, "to receive eternal life" or, "to live with God forever." Also consider how "eternal life" was translated on **[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]** and see the note about that there.
  * **Why do you call me 'good'** - Jesus is not denying that he is God. Rather, he is asking if the ruler understands that Jesus is God.
  * **There is only one who is good, and that is God** - Another way to say this would be, "The only one who is truly good is God" or, "God is the only one who is truly good."
