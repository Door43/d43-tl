Sumigaw ng napakalakas ang lalaki at sinabing “Ano bang gusto mo sa akin Jesus, Anak ng kataas-taasang Diyos? Pakiusap wag mo akong pahirapan! ” Tinanong siya ni Jesus, “Ano ang pangalan mo?” Sumagot ang demonyo “Ako si Lehiyon, dahil marami kami.” (Lehiyon ang tawag sa libo-libong pulutong ng mga sundalong Romano.)
