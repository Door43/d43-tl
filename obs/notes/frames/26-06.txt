Pinagpatuloy ni Jesus ang pagsasalita, “Noong panahon ng propetang si Elisha marami din sa Israel ang may sakit sa balat pero hindi pinagaling ng propeta ang kahit isa sa kanila. Si Naaman lang na kapitan ng mga kaaway ng Israel ang pinagaling ni Elisha.” Mga Hudyo ang nakikinig kay Jesus kaya nagalit sila sa kanya nang marinig nila ang mga sinabi niya.
