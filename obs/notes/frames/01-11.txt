Sa gitna ng halamanan nagtanim ang Diyos ng dalawang di-pangkaraniwang puno. Ang puno ng buhay at ang puno ng kaalaman ng mabuti't masama. Sinabi ng Diyos kay Adam na pwede niyang kainin ang mga bunga ng puno sa halamanan maliban lang sa bunga ng puno na nagbibigay ng kaalaman ng mabuti’t masama dahil ikamamatay niya kapag kinain niya ang bunga nito.
