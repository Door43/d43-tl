Isang araw habang nagdarasal at nag-aayuno ang mga Kristiyano sa Antioch sinabi sa kanila ng Banal na Espiritu, “Ibukod niyo sina Barnabas at Saul para sa gawaing inilaan ko para sa kanila.” Kaya ipinanalangin ng mga mananampalataya sa Antioch sina Barnabas at Saul. Ipinatong nila ang mga kamay nila sa kanila pagkatapos ay pinapunta nila sila sa maraming lugar para ipangaral ang mabuting balita tungkol kay Jesus. Nagturo sila sa mga iba’t-ibang lahi at marami ang naniwala kay Jesus.
