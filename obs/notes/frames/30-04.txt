===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Late in the day** - This could also be translated as, "When it was almost evening."
  * **Send the people away** - This could be translated as, "Please tell the people to go to a town" or, "Shouldn't you tell the people to go somewhere?" or, "Let the people go to a town." Make sure it sounds like a polite request, not an order.
