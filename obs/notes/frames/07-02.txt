Isang araw pagbalik ni Esau galing sa pangangaso, gutom na gutom siya kaya sinabi niya kay Jacob, “Pwede mo ba akong bigyan ng pagkaing niluto mo?” Sumagot naman si Jacob, “Ibigay mo muna sa akin ang mga karapatan mo bilang panganay.” Pumayag naman si Esau kaya naman binigyan siya ni Jacob ng pagkain.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **give me some of the food … give me your rights** – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for "give" here. This would also apply to, "Esau gave … Jacob gave" in the last two sentences.
  * **rights as the oldest son** - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.
