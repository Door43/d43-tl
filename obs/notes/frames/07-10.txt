{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-07-10.jpg?nolink&}}

Pero matagal nang napatawad ni Esau si Jacob kaya masayang-masaya silang nagkita ulit. Namuhay na ng tahimik si Jacob sa Canaan. Pagkatapos, namatay si Isaac at sila ang naglibing sa ama nila. At ang pangako ng Diyos kay Abraham at Isaac ay naipasa na kay Jacob.
