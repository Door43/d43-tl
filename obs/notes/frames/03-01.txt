  * **pagkatapos ng mahabang panahon**  - Nangyari ang kwentong ito maraming henerasyon na ang nakalipas (daang taon) matapos ang paglikha.
  * **very wicked and violent**  - It may be more natural to say, "had become wicked and did violent things".
  * **It became so bad**  â€“ It may be clearer to say, "People were behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God."
  * **God decided to destroy**  - This does not mean that the earth would be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and the birds.
  * **huge flood**  - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops of the highest mountains.
