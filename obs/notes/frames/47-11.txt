Nanginginig sa takot ang bantay habang papalapit kina Paul at Silas at tinanong niya sila, “Ano ba ang dapat kong gawin para maligtas?” Sumagot si Paul, “Maniwala ka kay Jesus, ang Panginoon, ikaw at ang pamilya mo ay maliligtas.” Pagkatapos noon ay sinama ng bantay si Paul at Silas sa bahay niya at hinugasan ang mga sugat nila. Ipinangaral ni Paul ang mabuting balita tungkol kay Jesus sa lahat ng naroon sa bahay nila.
