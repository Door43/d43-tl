===== Ako Ang Anak ng Diyos [39-04] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-39-04.jpg?nolink&}}

Sumagot si Jesus "Ako nga at makikita niyo akong nakaupo sa trono kasama ng Diyos at makikita niyo rin ako na manggagaling sa langit.” Pinunit ng punong pari ang damit niya sa sobrang galit at pasigaw niyang sinabi, “Hindi na natin kailangan ng iba pang mga saksi. Narinig niyo naman ang sinabi ni Jesus na siya ang Anak ng Diyos. Ano ang ihahatol niyo sa kanya?”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am** - That is, "I am as you said" or, "I am the Messiah and the Son of God." "I am" is also the name of God (See **[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:09-14|[09-14]]]**). By saying simply, "I am" Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible, translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus' answer and the name of God.
  * **seated with God** - This could be translated as, "reigning with God." Because God is the ruler over all, people talk about him as sitting on a throne in heaven. By saying that he would be seated with God, Jesus claimed that he had authority to rule with the Father.
  * **seated with God and coming from heaven** - This could be translated as, "sitting beside God and then coming from heaven."
  * **tore his clothes in anger** - The Jews would tear their clothes to show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, "he was extremely angry."
  * **What is your judgment?** - That is, "What is your decision?" or, "Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?" The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to condemn Jesus for claiming to be equal with God.
