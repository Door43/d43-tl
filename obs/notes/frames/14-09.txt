Nalungkot ang mga tao nang marinig nila ito. Nagsisi sila sa hindi pagsunod sa Diyos na sakupin ang Canaan kaya kinuha nila ang mga sandata nila at umalis para lumusob. Binalaan sila ni Moses na hindi dapat sila tumuloy dahil hindi sila sasamahan ng Diyos pero hindi sila nakinig at tumuloy pa rin sila.
