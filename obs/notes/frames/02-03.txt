Sinagot naman ng babae ang ahas , “Sinabi sa amin ng Diyos na pwede naming kainin ang bunga sa kahit anong puno maliban lang sa bunga ng puno na nagbibigay ng kaalaman ng mabuti’t masama.” Sinabi din sa amin ng Diyos, “Kapag kinain niyo o kaya hinawakan ninyo ang bunga, mamamatay kayo.”

===== Important Terms: =====

  * **[[tl/obe/kt/god]]**
  * **[[tl/obe/kt/good]]**
  * **[[tl/obe/kt/evil]]**
  * **[[tl/obe/kt/death]]**

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **fruit**  - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
  * **tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
  * **you will die**  - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
