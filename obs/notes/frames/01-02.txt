Pagkatapos sinabi ng Diyos, “Magkaroon ng liwanag!”At nagkaroon nga ng liwanag. Nakita ng Diyos na maganda ang liwanag at tinawag niya itong “Araw.” Hiniwalay Niya ito sa dilim at tinawag niya itong “Gabi.” Ginawa ng Diyos ang liwanag sa unang araw ng paglikha.

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **God said**  - God created light by means of a simple verbal command.
  * **let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, "God said, 'There will be light.'"
  * **light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
  * **was good**  - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished his plan and purpose.
  * **creation**  - This word is used here to refer to the six-day period during which God made everything that exists.
