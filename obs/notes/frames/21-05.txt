===== Ang Bagong Kasunduan [21-05] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-21-05.jpg?nolink&}}

Ipinangako din ng Diyos na gagawa siya ng Bagong Kasunduan sa pamamagitan ng propeta na si Jeremiah pero hindi kagaya ng kasunduan ng Diyos at mga Israelita na ginawa sa Bundok Sinai. Sa Bagong Kasunduan isusulat ng Diyos ang mga utos niya sa puso ng mga tao at mas makikilala nila siya. Magiging sakop sila ng Diyos at papatawarin niya ang mga kasalanan nila. Magsisimula ang Bagong Kasunduan pagdating ng Messiah.

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **Through the prophet Jeremiah God promised** â€“ This could be translated as, "Through the messages that God gave to Jeremiah, God promised" or, "The prophet Jeremiah told the people God's promise."
  * **but not like** - The New Covenant would be truly effective. People really would know God, they would truly live as his people, and He would forgive their sins completely, based on the Messiah's sacrifice of himself one time for all who believe in him.
  * **write his law on the people's hearts** - This is a metaphor meaning, "help his people to understand his laws and to earnestly desire to obey them." If possible, keep the image of writing on their hearts, since this is in contrast with the way God had written his law on stone tablets for the Israelites. If that is not possible, you could just translate the meaning.
  * **be his people** - This could be translated as, "be his special people" or, "be his favored people."
  * **start the New Covenant** - That is, "be the one to cause the New Covenant to take effect" or, "bring the New Covenant to his people."
