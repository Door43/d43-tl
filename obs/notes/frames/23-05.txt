Nang dumating sila sa Bethlehem, wala silang matuluyan na bahay. Ang nahanap lang nilang pwedeng matuluyan ay silungan ng mga hayop. Doon na niya naipanganak ang sanggol. Inihiga nila ang sanggol sa lalagyan ng pagkain ng mga hayop dahil walang higaan para sa kanya. Pinangalanan nila siyang Jesus.

===== Mga Mahahalagang Salita: =====

  * **[[:tl:obe:other:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:jesus|Jesus, Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus]]**

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **no place to stay** - That is, "no usual place to stay." Because Bethlehem was so crowded at that time, the usual rooms for guests were already full of people.
  * **place where animals stayed** - This was a place for sheltering animals, not a place where people lived. Translate this with a term that would normally be used for a place where animals were kept.
  * **feeding trough** - That is, "animal feed box" or, "wooden or stone box for feeding animals." The box could have been filled with hay to provide a padded surface for the baby to lie on.
