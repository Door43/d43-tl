Sampung taon na ang lumipas mula nang dumating sa Canaan sila Abram at Sarai pero wala pa din silang anak kaya sinabi ni Sarai kay Abram, “Tutal hindi ako pinayagang magkaroon ng anak at ngayon napakatanda ko na para magkaroon pa ng anak. Heto ang alipin ko na si Hagar, gawin mo rin siyang asawa para mabigyan niya din ako ng anak.”
