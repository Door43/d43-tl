Nang anim na buwan ng buntis si Elizabeth nagpakita ulit ang nasabing anghel sa kamag-anak niya na si Mary. Dalaga pa siya at nakatakdang magpakasal kay Joseph. Sinabi sa kanya ng anghel, “Mabubuntis ka at sanggol na lalaki ang ipapanganak mo. Jesus ang ipangalan mo sa kanya. Tatawagin siyang Anak ng Kataas-taasang Diyos at maghahari siya magpakailanman.”
