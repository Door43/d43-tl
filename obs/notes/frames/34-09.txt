“Samantala nakatayo naman sa di kalayuan ang maniningil ng buwis at hindi man lang siya makatingala sa langit at sa halip ay kinakabog niya ang dibdib niya habang nananalangin ng ganito, ‘Diyos ko, maawa kayo sa akin dahil makasalanan ako.”’

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **stood far away ** - This can also be translated as, "stood at a distance" or, "stayed separate."
  * **did not even look up to heaven** - The word "even" indicates that people normally looked up to heaven when praying to God, but that this man did not because he was so ashamed of his sin.
  * **he pounded on his chest with his fist** - This could also be translated as, "because of his grief, he hit his chest with his fist" or, "he pounded his chest in sorrow." If people would find this hard to understand because they beat their chest for other reasons, you could translate this as, "he showed his despair."
