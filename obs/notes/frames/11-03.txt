===== Ang Pagpapahid ng Dugo [11-03] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-11-03.jpg?nolink&}}

Sinabihan ng Diyos ang mga Israelita na dapat silang maglagay ng dugo ng tupa sa gilid at itaas ng pintuan ng mga bahay nila at ihawin ang tupa at kainin agad kasama ng tinapay na walang pampaalsa. Sinabihan din sila ng Diyos na maging handa sa pag-alis nila sa Egypt pagkatapos kumain.

===== Mga Mahahalagang Salita: =====

  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:god|Diyos]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:other:israel|Israel, Israelita]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:lamb|kordero, tupa]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:blood|dugo]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:other:egypt|Egypt, Egyptian]]**

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **made without yeast**  – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough that makes the dough expand and it also makes the bread rise as it bakes. This could be translated as, "made without something that would make it rise." Making the bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly.
  * **when they ate**  – This means they needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat.
