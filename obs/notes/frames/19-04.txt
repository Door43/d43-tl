Kaya pumunta si Elijah sa kalapit na bansa at mayroong babaeng balo sa lugar na iyon na may anak na lalaki. Nang panahon na iyon malapit na silang maubusan ng pagkain dahil tag-gutom noon at hindi umuulan pero kahit ganoon, pinatuloy pa rin nila si Elijah at pinakain ng natitira nilang pagkain kaya biniyayaan sila ng Diyos. Hindi na sila naubusan ng harina at langis kaya nagkaroon sila ng pagkain sa buong panahon ng tag-gutom. Nanatili doon si Elijah ng ilang mga taon.
