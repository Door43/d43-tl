Pagkalipas ng tatlo’t kalahating taon sinabi ng Diyos kay Elijah na bumalik na siya sa kaharian ng Israel at kausapin niya si Ahab dahil magkakaroon na ulit ng ulan. Pero nang makita ni Haring Ahab si Elijah sinabi niya, “Nandito ka na pala, ikaw na dahilan ng paghihirap namin”. Sumagot naman si Elijah, “Hindi! Ikaw ang totoong dahilan ng paghihirap dito dahil kinalimutan mo si Yahweh, ang tunay na Diyos, at sumamba ka kay Baal. Isama mo lahat ng mamamayan ng Kaharian ng Israel at papuntahin sa Bundok ng Carmel”.
