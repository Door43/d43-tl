  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **good soil** - That is, "fertile soil" or, "soil that was good for growing plants."
  * **He who has ears, let him hear!** - This saying means, "Everyone who hears what I am saying should listen to me carefully" or, "If anyone hears what I have said, he should pay attention to what I mean." This can also be translated as a command. "Since you have ears to hear, listen carefully to what I am saying."
