Pagkatapos ng dalawang taon nakakulong pa rin si Joseph kahit wala siyang kasalanan. Isang gabi nanaginip ng dalawang beses ang Paraon, ito ang tawag ng mga tao sa Egypt sa hari nila. Lubos siyang nabahala at wala man lang ni isa sa mga tagapayo niya ang makapagpaliwanag ng ibig sabihin ng panaginip niya.
