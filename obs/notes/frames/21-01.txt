Noong una pa lang plinano na ng Diyos na isugo ang Messiah. Una itong naipangako kina Adam at Eve. Ipinangako ng Diyos na manggagaling kay Eve ang dudurog sa ulo ng ahas. Ang ahas na nanloko kay Eve ay si Satan. Ang pangako na iyon ay nangangahulugan na tuluyang matatalo ng Messiah si Satan.

  * **The snake…was Satan** – Satan spoke to Eve in the form of a snake. This does not mean that he is a snake now. This could be translated as, "The snake…was an appearance of Satan."
  * **who deceived Eve** - That is, "who lied to Eve." The snake lied by making Eve doubt what God had said and tricking her into disobeying God.
