"Sumagot muli ang mga lingkod, 'Dapat ba naming bunutin ang mga damo?' Sinabi ng amo, 'Huwag, may mga mabubunot rin kayong mga trigo kung gagawin niyo iyon. Hintayin ninyo ang anihan at saka ninyo tipunin ang mga damo para sunugin, kunin niyo naman ang mga trigo at dalhin sa aking kamalig."'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell the story.)
  * **you will pull out some of the wheat as well** - That is, "you will accidentally pull out some of the wheat also." It would be too difficult to distinguish young wheat from the weeds, and to pull the weeds without uprooting the wheat.
  * **until the harvest** - That is, "until the time when the wheat is ready to harvest" or, "until the wheat has grown enough to be harvested."
  * **the wheat** - That is, "the harvested wheat grains."
  * **barn** - This refers to the building where the harvested wheat grain was saved and stored. It could also be called a "storehouse."
