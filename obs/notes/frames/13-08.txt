Nagbigay din ang Diyos ng saktong paglalarawan ng isang tolda na gusto niyang ipagawa sa kanila. Tinawag nila itong Tolda ng Pagpupulong. Mayroong dalawang malaking kwarto ang tolda dahil hinahati ito ng isang malaking kurtina. Walang pwedeng pumasok sa kwarto sa likod ng kurtina maliban sa pinakapunong pari dahil doon bumababa ang presensya ng Diyos.
