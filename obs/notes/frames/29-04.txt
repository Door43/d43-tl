“Lumuhod ang lingkod sa harapan ng hari at nakiusap, ‘Pagpasensyahan niyo muna po sana ako, babayaran ko rin naman po ang lahat ng mga utang ko sa inyo.’ Naawa ang hari at dahil dito kinalimutan na niya lahat ng mga utang ng lingkod at pinayagan na siyang umalis”

  * **felt pity** - That is, "felt compassion for" or, "felt sorry for." The king knew that the servant and his family would suffer greatly if they were sold into slavery.
