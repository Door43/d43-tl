Ipinako si Jesus sa gitna ng dalawang magnanakaw. Ininsulto ng isa sa kanila si Jesus pero pinagsabihan naman siya ng isa pang magnanakaw, “Dapat kang matakot sa Diyos dahil walang kasalanan ang taong ito at tayo ang may nagawang kasalanan. Nakiusap ang magnanakaw na iyon kay Jesus, “Alalahanin mo ako sa iyong kaharian.” Sinagot naman siya ni Jesus at sinabing, “Sa araw na ito, isasama kita sa Paraiso.”

  * **two robbers** - This could also be translated as, "two bandits." This refers to criminals who used force or violence to steal things.

  * **We are guilty but this man is innocent** - This could be translated as, "You and I have done evil things and deserve to die, but this man, Jesus, has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to die." "We" here includes both robbers, but does not include Jesus.
  * **this man** - This phrase refers to Jesus.
  * **Please remember me** - That is, "Please accept me" or, "Please welcome me" or, "Please allow me to be with you." "Remember" here does not mean to recall something after forgetting it. Translate this in a way that communicates a humble request.
