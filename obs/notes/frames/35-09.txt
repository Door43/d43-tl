“Pero agad na inutusan ng ama ang isa sa mga alipin niya, “Dali! Kunin mo ang pinakamagarang damit at isuot mo sa anak ko.  Suotan niyo siya ng singsing at sandalyas pagkatapos katayin niyo ang pinakamatabang baka at magdiwang tayo dahil namatay ang anak ko pero nabuhay siyang muli. Nawala siya pero ngayon, nahanap na.”’

===== Mga Mahahalagang Salita: =====

  * **[[:tl:obe:other:servant|lingkod, alipin, pagkaka-alipin]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:son|anak na lalaki]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:death|Kamatayan, Patay, Mamatay]]**

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **the best calf** - This could also be translated as, "the fattest calf." This was the calf that had been fattened so that when cooked it would taste the best.
  * **My son was dead, but now he is alive!** - That is, "This is like my son was dead and is alive again!" or, "I grieved as if my son had died, but now I rejoice because it is as if he has come back to life!" The father is using this expression to show how happy he is that his son has come home.
  * **He was lost, but now he is is found!** - That is, "This is like I had lost him but now I have found him." This expression also shows how happy the father is about having his son at home again.
