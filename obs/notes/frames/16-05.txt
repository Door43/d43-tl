Isang araw may isang binatang Israelita na nagngangalang Gideon na patagong nagpapagpag ng trigo para hindi ito makuha ng mga Midianita. Habang nagpapagpag si Gideon kinausap siya ng isang anghel mula sa Diyos, “Matapang na mandirigma, humayo ka at sasamahan ka ng Diyos para iligtas ang mga Israelita mula sa mga Midianita.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **threshing grain** - The grain was wheat, which has a head of many small grains, or seeds, on the top of a thin stalk. "Threshing" is separating the seeds of the plant from the stalks by beating the heads of grain. The seeds are food, but the stalks are not.
  * **secretly** - Gideon was threshing the grain in a hidden location, so the Midianites would not see him.
  * **God is with you** – This means, "God is present with you in a special way" or, "God has plans to use you in a special way."
