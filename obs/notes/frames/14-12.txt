Mahimalang nagpapalabas ng tubig mula sa bato ang Diyos para sa kanila. Pero sa kabila ng lahat nagrereklamo at sinisisi pa rin ng mga tao ang Diyos at si Moses. Kahit ganoon, nanatili pa ring tapat ang Diyos sa mga panagako niya kina Abraham, Isaac at Jacob.

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **miraculously gave them water from a rock** - This could be translated, "by doing something that only God can do, he made water pour out of a rock so the people and animals could drink."
  * **But despite all this** - This could be translated as, "But even though God provided food, water, clothing, and everything that they needed."
  * **Even so** - This could be translated, "Even though the Israelites complained and grumbled against him."
  * **God was still faithful to his promises** - This could be translated, "God continued to do what he had told Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob he would do." He provided their descendants with what they needed so they that could live and become a great nation and eventually own the land of Canaan.
