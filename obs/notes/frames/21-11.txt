Ayon pa kay Isaiah, kamumuhian at itatakwil ang Messiah ng walang dahilan. Sinabi rin ng mga ibang propeta na magpupustahan ang mga taong papatay sa Messiah para malaman kung sino ang makakakuha sa damit niya at pagtataksilan siya ng isang kaibigan. Si Zecariah naman ang nagsabi na pagtataksilan ang Messiah ng isang kaibigan niya kapalit ng 30 pirasong baryang pilak.
