“Hindi nagtagal, isang Paring Hudyo ang napadaan din doon. Nang makita ng Pari ang lalaking binugbog at pinagnakawan, lumihis siya ng daan, hindi niya pinansin ang lalaking nangangailangan ng tulong, at nagpatuloy sa pag-alis.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell the story.)
  * **happened to walk down** - That is, "happened to be traveling along." For some languages it may be necessary to use a word like "travel" rather than "walk" since the priest was not just walking on the road but was traveling to get to another city.
  * **ignored the man** - That is, "did not help the man" or, "showed no concern for the man."
  * **kept on going** - That is, "continued traveling down the road."
