===== Ang Mga Binayarang Saksi [39-02] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-39-02.jpg?nolink&}}

Sa loob ng bahay sinimulan ng mga pinuno ng mga Hudyo ang paglilitis kay Jesus. Nagsama sila ng mga saksi na magsasabi ng mga kasinungalingan tungkol sa kanya ngunit hindi nagtutugma-tugma ang mga paratang nila kaya hindi napatunayan ng mga pinuno ng mga Hudyo na may nagawa siyang kahit na anong kasalanan. Hindi ipinagtanggol ni Jesus ang sarili niya.
