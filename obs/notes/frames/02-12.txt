{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-12.jpg?nolink&}}

Sinabi ng Diyos, "Ngayon na tulad na natin ang tao na may kaalaman tungkol sa mabubuti at masasama, hindi sila dapat payagang makakain ng bunga na nagbibigay buhay para hindi sila mabuhay magpakailanman." Kaya pinaalis ng Diyos si Adam at Eve sa magandang halamanan. Naglagay siya ng mga makapangyarihang anghel sa pasukan ng halamanan para walang sinuman ang makakain ng bunga na nagbibigay buhay.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **like us by knowing good and evil**  - Here, this phrase points to a new way that Adam and Eve would be like God. Because they had sinned, they were aware of evil and could experience it. You could say, “because now they knew both good and evil.”
  * **fruit**  - The specific kind of fruit is not revealed, so it is best to translate this using a general word for fruit.
  * **tree of life**  - This was an actual tree with fruit. See **[[tl/obs/notes/frames/01-11|[01-11]]]**. If a person ate this fruit he would live continually and never die.
