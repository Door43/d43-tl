Sinabi ng Diyos sa lalaki, “Nakinig ka sa asawa mo at sinuway mo ako. Ngayon ay sinumpa ang lupa, kailangan mong maghirap sa pagtatrabaho para may makain. Mamamatay ka at babalik sa lupa ang katawan mo.” Tinawag ng lalaki na “Eve” ang asawa niya na ibig sabihi’y “Nagbibigay buhay” dahil siya ang magiging ina ng lahat ng tao. Pagkatapos dinamitan ng Diyos sila Adam at Eve ng damit na gawa sa balat ng hayop.
