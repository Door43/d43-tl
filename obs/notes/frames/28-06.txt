Sinabi ni Jesus sa mga apostol, "Talagang napakahirap para sa mga mayayaman ang makapasok sa kaharian ng Diyos. Totoong mas madali pang makapasok ang isang kamelyo sa butas ng karayom kaysa sa isang mayaman na makapasok sa kaharian ng Diyos."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **enter the kingdom of God** - This can also be translated as, "become a citizen in God's kingdom."
  * **camel** - Camels are very large animals that are often used to carry heavy loads. If camels are not known in your language area, a phrase such as, "very large animal" or, "beast of burden" could be used. If you choose to substitute the name of some other large animal, make sure that the animal would have been known by the people Jesus was talking to, such as, "ox" or, "donkey."
  * **eye of a needle** - This refers to the tiny hole in the end of a sewing needle. The idea of something as large as a camel going through the eye of a needle is intended to represent something that is impossible.
