Nang nilikha ng Diyos ang mundo ang lahat ay maayos at walang kapintasan. Wala pang kasalanan noon sa mundo. Nagmamahalan si Adam at Eve at mahal nila ang Diyos. Wala pang karamdaman at kamatayan dahil ganitong klase ng mundo ang gusto ng Diyos.

===== Mga Mahahalagang Salita: =====

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God created the world** - That is, "God made the world out of nothing."
  * **perfect** - That is, "exactly as it should be" to accomplish all that God intended for it.
  * **There was no sin** - For some languages it is not possible to express "sin" as a thing, rather it is an action. In those cases this could be translated as, "No one ever sinned" or, "People did not sin" or, "Nothing evil had happened."
  * **There was no sickness or death** - That is, "No one got sick and no one died" or, "They did not get sick or die."
