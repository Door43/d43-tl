Daan-daang taon ang lumipas at kinausap ng Diyos ang isang lalaking nagngangalang Abram. Sinabi ng Diyos sa kanya, “Iwanan mo ang bansa mo at pamilya mo at pumunta ka sa lupaing ituturo ko sayo. Pagpapalain kita at dadami ang anak mo at magiging isang malaking bansa. Gagawin kong dakila ang pangalan mo. Pagpapalain ko lahat ng magpapala sa iyo at susumpain ko lahat ng susumpa sa iyo. Dahil sa iyo pagpapalain ko lahat ng pamilya sa mundo.
