Ibinigay ng Diyos lahat ng kailangan ng mga Israelita sa 40 taong pagpapalaboy-laboy nila sa ilang. Binigyan sila ng Diyos ng tinapay mula sa langit na kung tawagin ay “Manna”. Pinapadalhan din sila ng Diyos ng maraming pugo na ibong katamtaman ang laki para makakain din sila ng karne. Noong mga panahong iyon, hindi man lang pinabayaan ng Diyos na masira ang mga damit at mga sandalyas nila.

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **God provided for them** – This could be translated as, "God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter."
  * **bread from heaven, called "manna"** - This thin, bread-like food fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it "manna." Almost every day the people gathered this "manna" and cooked it as their food.
  * **He also sent flocks of quail…camp** - Another way to say this would be, "He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp." If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, "a large number of medium-sized birds."
  * **their camp** - The place where the Israelites set up their tents to sleep in was called a "camp." It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.
