Pagkalipas ng tatlong araw, pagkatapos ihanda ng mga tao ang mga sarili nila sa pagdating ng Diyos, bumaba ang Diyos sa ibabaw ng Bundok ng Sinai. May kasamang kulog, kidlat, usok at malakas na tunog ng trumpeta sa pagbaba niya. Si Moses lang ang pinayagan ng Diyos na umakyat sa bundok.

  * **Three days later** - In other words, three days after they arrived at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them.
  * **prepared themselves spiritually** - This refers to ceremonial cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated as, "got ready to meet with God" or, "prepared themselves to meet with God."
  * **loud trumpet blast** - This could be translated as, "and a loud sound came from a horn" or, "and a horn was blown and it made a loud sound" or, "and they heard the loud sound of a horn blowing."
