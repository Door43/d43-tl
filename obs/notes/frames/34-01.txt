Maraming ikinuwento si Jesus tungkol sa kaharian ng Diyos. Ito ang mga halimbawa, “Ang paghahari ng Diyos ay katulad ng buto ng mustasa na itinanim ng isang tao sa kanyang taniman. Alam niyong ito ang pinakamaliit na buto sa lahat.”

===== Important Terms: =====

  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:jesus]]**
  * **[[:tl:obe:kt:kingdomofgod]]**


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **stories** - Jesus used these stories to teach truths about God's kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If your language has a term that includes both fictional and real stories, you should use it here.
  * **mustard seed** - This probably refers to the seed of the black mustard plant, which has tiny seeds that rapidly grow into very large plants. If there is a word for this plant in your language, you should use it. If not, you may need to substitute the name of another plant which has the same characteristics.
  * **the smallest seed of all** - That is, "the smallest of all the seeds that people plant."
