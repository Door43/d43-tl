{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-10.jpg?nolink&}}

32,000 na sundalong Israelita ang tumugon sa panawagan ni Gideon at pumunta sa kanya pero sinabi ng Diyos na masyado itong marami. Dahil dito pinauwi na ni Gideon ang 22,000 na takot lumaban pero sinabi ng Diyos sa kanya na marami pa rin sila kaya pumili si Gideon ng 300 na sundalo at ang iba naman ay pinauwi na niya.

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon** - Some languages might need to insert the following sentence at the beginning of the story: "Gideon called the Israelites to come fight against the Midianites." See **[[:tl:obs:notes:frames:16-08|[16-08]]]**.
  * **too many** - This was more soldiers than God wanted for this fight. If that many solders fought and won, they would think that they won the battle with their own strength, and they would not know that God did it.
  * **except for 300 soldiers** - This sentence could be translated as, "So Gideon allowed only 300 men to stay, and the rest of the men went home."
