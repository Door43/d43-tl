Gustong ibigay ni Isaac kay Esau ang pagpapala niya. Pero bago niya iyon nagawa, niloko siya ni Rebekah at Jacob. Nagkunwari si Jacob na siya si Esau. Matanda na si Isaac at hindi na siya makakita. Isinuot ni Jacob ang damit ni Esau at naglagay siya ng balat ng kambing sa leeg at mga braso niya.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **give his blessing** - It was customary for fathers to formally express their desire for good things to happen to their children. Normally the older son received the best promise. Isaac wanted this extra prosperity to happen to Esau.
  * **tricked him** - The word "trick" means to do something to deliberately deceive someone. Rebekah came up with a plan to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the special blessing instead of Esau.
  * **pretend** - The word "pretend" shows how Jacob would deceive his father (who had very poor eyesight in his old age).
  * **goatskins** - The hairiness of the goatskins would make Jacob feel like Esau.
