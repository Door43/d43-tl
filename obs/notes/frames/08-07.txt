Binigyan ng Diyos si Joseph ng kakayahang makapagpaliwanag ng mga panaginip kaya inilabas siya ng Paraon mula sa bilangguan at ipinatawag. Naipaliwanag nga ni Joseph ang ibig sabihin ng panaginip ng Paraon at sinabi niya, “Sa loob ng pitong taon bibigyan kayo ng Diyos ng masaganang ani pero pitong taon na tag-gutom ang susunod.”
