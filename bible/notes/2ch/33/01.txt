\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
\v 2 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like the disgusting things of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel.
\v 3 For he rebuilt the shrines that Hezekiah, his father, had pulled down, and he built altars for the Baals, 
made Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the stars of heaven and worshiped them.
