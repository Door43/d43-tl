But you are a God who forgives us and who acts kindly and mercifully \add toward us\add*. You do not quickly become angry. You are always faithfully loving us.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **But they and our ancestors** - Here "they" refers to the Israelites at the time of Moses, and "our" refers to the people of Israel. 
  * **they were stubborn...became stubborn** - The literal statement is "they hardened their necks" (See: [[tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the wonders that you had done among them** - "the miracles that you had done among them"
  * **they appointed a leader to return to their slavery** - "They appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery." After the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites talked about appointing such a leader. (See: [[tl:bible:notes:num:14:04|Num 14:04]] and [[tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **who is full of forgiveness** - "who is ready to forgive"
