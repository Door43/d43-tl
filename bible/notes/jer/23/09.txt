\v 9 Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble. I have become like a drunk man,
\q like a man whom wine has overpowered, because of Yahweh and his holy words.
\q
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers. Because of these the land mourns.
\q The meadows in the wilderness dry up. These prophets' paths are wicked; their power is not used in a right manner.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In verse 9 the speaker changes from Yahweh to Jeremiah.

  * **my heart is broken in me and all of my bones tremble**  - This expression describes Jeremiah's deep sense of fear. (See : [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered**  - This phrase compares the effect of alcohol the effect of great fear on a person. Just like wine and alcohol can cause a person to lose control of their body, so can a person with great fear lose control physically. (See : [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **the land is full of adulterers**  - This exaggeration is used to show the level of sinfulness which was present at the time of Jeremiah. (See : [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the land mourns**  - Here the land is presented as a human who is weeping or mourning due to the sinfulness of the people who live in it. (See : [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
