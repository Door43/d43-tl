\v 1 When Jehoiakim had been the king of Judah for almost four years, Yahweh gave this message to me:
\v 2 "Get a scroll, and write on it the messages that I have given to you regarding Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Write all of the messages, starting from the time that I gave you the first message, when Josiah was the king, up until now.
\v 3 When the people of Judah hear again about all the disasters that I plan to cause them to experience, perhaps each one of them will repent. If they do that, I will be able to forgive them for the wrong\f + \ft Or: evil \f* things that they have done."
