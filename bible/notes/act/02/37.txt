\v 37 Now when they heard this they were pierced in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles,
"Brothers, what shall we do?"
\v 38 And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the
forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For to you is the promise and to your children and to all that are far off,
as many people as the Lord our God will call."
