===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He was declared**  - The word "he" refers to Jesus Christ. The phrase "was declared" could be restated with an active verb: "God declared him." (See: [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **spirit of holiness**  - This refers to the Holy Spirit.
  * **by the resurrection from the dead**  - "by bringing him back to life after he died"
  * **we have received grace and apostleship**  - "God has graciously given me a gift. He has appointing me to be an apostle." Alternate translation: "God has given me the gracious gift of being an apostle." Here the word "we" refers to Paul and to the 12 apostles that followed Jesus but excludes the believers in the church in Rome. (See: [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|Exclusive]], [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys|Hendiadys]])
  * **for obedience of faith among all the nations, for the sake of his name**  - Paul uses the word "name" to refer to Jesus. Alternate translation: "in order to teach all nations to obey because of their faith in Him" (See: [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
