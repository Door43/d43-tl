\q1
\v 5 House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
\q1
\v 6 For you have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob, 
\q1 because they are filled
with customs from the east  and are omen readers like the Philistines, 
\q1 and they shake hands with sons of foreigners.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In 2:5 Isaiah was speaking to the people of Israel.
In 2:6 Isaiah was speaking to God.

  * **O house of Jacob** - "you descendants of Jacob" (UDB) or "You people of Israel" (See: [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For you have abandoned your people** - "For you have rejected your people" or "For you have left your people." Here the word "you" refers to Yahweh. 
  * **they are filled with customs from the east** - "they act like the people who live in lands east of Israel and do not know God"
  * **omen readers** - "sooth sayers" or "diviners." This refers to people who claim to know what will happen the future.
  * **and they shake hands with sons of foreigners** - Alternate translation: "they make agreements with people who are not from Israel." (See: [[tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they worship the craftsmanship of their own hands, things that their own fingers have made.** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "they worship things that they themselves have made." (See: [[tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
