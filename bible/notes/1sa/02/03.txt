===== Translation Notes: =====

Hannah continues speaking. Here she speaks as if other people were there listening to her.

  * **actions are weighed** - God understands why people act as they do. AT: "he weighs people's actions" or "he evaluates what people do"
  * **those who stumble put on strength like a belt** - They will no longer stumble, but their strength will remain with them as tightly as if it were a belt. AT: "They will no longer stumble but will remain strong." (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
