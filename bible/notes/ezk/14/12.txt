\v 13 "You human, if \add the people of some\add* country sin against me by abandoning me, and I punish [IDI] them by cutting off their food supply and by sending a famine, with the result that people and animals die,
\v 14 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, they would save only themselves because of their being righteous. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.

\v 12 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 13 "Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a sin so that I reach out with my hand against it and break the
staff of its bread, and send out over it a famine and cut off both man and beast from the land;
\v 14 then even if  these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in the land's midst, they could only rescue their own selves by their
righteousness." This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
