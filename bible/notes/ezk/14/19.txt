====== Ezekiel 14:19-20 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 Or, if I send a plague into that land and cause the people and the animals to die \add from the plague\add* because I am very angry with those people,
\v 20 as surely as I am alive, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in that country, they would not be able to save even their sons and daughters. They would save only themselves because of their being righteous. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.

\v 19 Or if I send a plague against this land and pour out my fury against it through bloodshed, in order to cut off both man and beast,
\v 20 then even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in that landâ€”as I live," declares the Lord Yahweh, "they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters; only their own lives would be rescued by their righteousness."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **pour out my fury** - Like a jar holds water, God had been holding back judgement.  So "pour out my fury" means God will no longer hold back from acting on his anger but will act on his anger against the people of Israel. (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cut off both man and beast**  - This phrase refers to being killed as an act of divine judgment for sin. AT: "kill both man and beast" (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
