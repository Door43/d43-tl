===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I see him, but he is not here now. I look at him, but he is not near.** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Balaam is having a vision of a future event. The word "him" refers to a future leader of Israel. (See: [[:tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **A star will come out of Jacob** - Here "star" refers to an Israelite king that will rise in power. (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a scepter will rise out of Israel** - This means the same thing as the first part of the sentence. A king shall rise out of Israel. (See: [[:tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all the descendants of Seth** - This refers to the Moabites who were descendants of Seth.
