  * **They speak against the heavens**  - The word "heavens" here represents God. AT: "They speak against God, who is in heaven" (See: [[:tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **their tongues roam through the earth**  - Here the word "tongues" represent the wicked person. (See: [[:tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
