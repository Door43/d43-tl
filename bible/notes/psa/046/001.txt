  * **God is our refuge and strength** - God is described as a strong place, safe from attack. AT: "God is the reason we are safe" (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the heart of the sea**- The sea depths are inside the sea like a heart is inside of a person or animal. AT: "into the depths of the sea" (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **mountains tremble with their swelling** - This phrase describes a volcano that is about to erupt.
