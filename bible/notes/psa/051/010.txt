===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Create in me a clean heart, God,**  - The author is asking for God to remove sinful desire from him. AT: "O God, cause my inner being to be pure," (UDB) (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and renew a right spirit within me**  This is very similar to the first line, asking God to help the author to live a righteous life. (See: [[:tl:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:tl:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Do not drive me**  - "Do not send me"
