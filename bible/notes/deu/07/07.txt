<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh did not set his love upon you or choose you because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples â€”
\v 8 but he loves you, and he wished to keep the oath that he had sworn to your fathers. This is why Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
