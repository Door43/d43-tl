\v 4 \add From now until he is born\add*, you must not drink any wine or other alcoholic\f + \ft Or: fermented \f* drink, and you must not eat any food that will make you unacceptable to God.
\v 5 Actually, you are already pregnant. After you give birth to your son, you must never allow his hair to be cut. He must be dedicated to God from the day he is born until the day he dies. He is the one who will rescue the Israelite people from the people of Philistia."

\v 5 Take care, because you will become pregnant.  After you give birth to your son, no one must ever cut his hair. He will be dedicated to God even before he is born until the day he dies. He is the one who will rescue the Israelite people from the Philistines."

\v 3 The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman and said to her, “See now, you have been unable to become pregnant, and you have not given birth, but you will become pregnant and you will give birth to a son.
\v 4 Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat any food that the law declares to be unclean. 

\v 5 Look, you will become pregnant and give birth to a son. No razor must come onto his head, for the child will be a Nazirite to God from the time he is in your womb. He will begin to deliver Israel from the power of the Philistines.”
